# Linear-Regression
My first attempt at **Gradient Descent.**\
Based on *The Coding Train's* tutorial, but translated to java, and relying as little as possible on exact code.

## Description
This is a simple **Processing** project that generates a linear regression given points placed by mouse clicks. It has the option to generate the line through both a formula and through gradient descent, but the latter method is not functioning properly for an unknown reason.

## Python
After getting frustrated with this, I ended up trying to do it in python using matplotlib to show the line and points, and I got that to work perfectly. So while this particular project may not have been a success, I was in the end able to get a functioning linear regression calculator with gradient descent.

## Features I Might Add Later
* **MAKE IT WORK**
* **The option of moving and deleting points and setting exact coordinates** (I like how quick and easy it is to get approximations with this program, but a little more specificity could be handy)
* **Flipping it so that (0,0) is the bottom left instead of top left, and maybe centering it so negative values show**
* **Clean up the code that draws the line** (I'm kinda proud of the way that I figured out how to do this, but I know it's messy and not optimal)
* **Make it an Android app or Chrome extension** (it could be useful in some scenarios, but I'm not sure how useful, so we'll see)
